# Learn by SimplyHelp

This repository contains learning resources and documentation created for customers of SimplyHelp services and GIS professionals alike.

## Table of Contents

*   [ArcGIS REST API works](https://simplyhelp.github.io/learn/arcgisrestapi) - Learn about and how to use the ArcGIS REST API. This powers all data queries in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise. 
*   [How 8-bit Binary Math works](https://simplyhelp.github.io/learn/binarymath.html) - 8-bits/Bytes are the foundation of modern computers. Learn how 8-bits are used to store 256 unique numbers ranging from 0 through 255. 
*   [Tornado Dashboard Example](https://simplyhelp.github.io/learn/dashboard.html) - A dashboard created as a demonstration of using only open-source tools and GeoJSON storage. It uses the Northern Tornado Project data to power the map, but could be easily "swapped" to include any dataset. It is a simple base to build your own dashboard using your own data and is free to use. Just reference the original creator as "Shawn Morgan". 
*   [Binary Math Calculator](https://simplyhelp.github.io/learn/binarymath.html) - A tool that demonstrates how bits combine to create byte numbers. It is used as a learning tool for those trying to better understand how data are stored on systems, particularly in the GIS Space. 
*   [CSRS](https://simplyhelp.github.io/learn/csrs-canada.html) - The Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS) is a collection of standards, models, data products and infrastructure supporting geospatial positioning in Canada. It includes the geometric, height and gravity reference systems that can be used in ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, etc. It has some quirks and this page tries to document how to get around those (like installing the transforms in ArcGIS!). 
*   [Plot Point](https://simplyhelp.github.io/learn/plotpoint.html) - In field work sampling is best done in regular intervals. This site helps create points at a specific interval along a specified line. It creates a GeoJSON file that can then be used on a mobile phone or GPS to navigate to those locations, acting as virtual stakes for repeat sampling. 

# Open Notable Resources

## Open GEDTM30 Digital Terrain Model (DTM)

GEDTM30 is a global 1-arc-second (~30m) Digital Terrain Model (DTM) built using a machine-learning-based data fusion approach. GEDTM30 is also used to generate 15 land surface parameters at six scales (30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 960m), covering aspects of topographic position, light and shadow, landform characteristics, and hydrology.
