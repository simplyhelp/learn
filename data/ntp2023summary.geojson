Satellite imagery review revealed some crop and tree damage along the tornado track. Start time is based on radar. This tornado developed east of the end point of the Tecumseh EF1 tornado.",

While the vortex (and spray vortex at the water surface) is visible in the video, darkness and heavy smoke obscure a clear view of cloud above. In order to confirm vortex contact with a parent storm aloft, NTP reviewed satellite imagery to determine if convective cloud was present in the area. While no evidence of a pyrocumulonimbus cloud was found in satellite imagery or lightning data, pyrocumulus (pyroCu) cloud was visible and determined to be the parent storm. As the pyroCu was associated with the active fire, this is considered a fire-generated tornado (often referred to as a 'pyro-tornado' or 'pyrotornado'). An area of snapped and uprooted trees at the shoreline near the tornado was reported. However, it is unclear if the tornado was over land at any point and caused the tree damage. NTP continues to seek out additional information for this event.",
